# VR-Project3
This is mine and Luciano Wolffe's repository for project 3 of our VR class. We propose a game like Sponge Ball in VR. We think it would be really simple to implement and fun to play.

# Proposal
Name: VR Ball

Description: The game would be inspired by Sponge Ball from the Spongebob Squarepants: the Movie Game. The user would control a ball in a VR environment where the goal is to reach a certain endpoint with different obstacles throughout the level.

Why VR: The VR platform is a good one for this game simply because it would be fun to control a VR. Samsung's VR controls also lend themselves to controlling the ball. It's just a simple trackpad that would allow movement in 360 degrees.

Software usage: The engine would be Unity 3D. The SDK we would use is Samsung GEAR VR SDK. Once again we would develop on Android phones but they would also have to be from Samsung and GEAR VR compatible.

Team members: Reynaldo Garcia and Luciano Wolff

Objects: We plan on creating all of the models and textures just like in Project 2.
