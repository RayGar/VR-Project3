# VR-Project3
This is mine and Luciano Wolffe's repository for project 3 of our VR class. We propose a game like Sponge Ball in VR. We think it would be really simple to implement and fun to play.

# Proposal
Name: VR Ball

Description: The game would be inspired by Sponge Ball from the Spongebob Squarepants: the Movie Game. The user would control a ball in a VR environment where the goal is to reach a certain endpoint with different obstacles throughout the level.

Why VR: The VR platform is a good one for this game simply because it would be fun to control a VR. Samsung's VR controls also lend themselves to controlling the ball. It's just a simple trackpad that would allow movement in 360 degrees.

Software usage: The engine would be Unity 3D. The SDK we would use is Samsung GEAR VR SDK. Once again we would develop on Android phones but they would also have to be from Samsung and GEAR VR compatible.

Team members: Reynaldo Garcia and Luciano Wolff

Objects: We plan on creating all of the models and textures just like in Project 2.

Libraries used - 
Engine: Unity 5
SDK: Samsung GEAR VR (not compatible with other VR SDKs)

# Installation Instructions:

You will need the following hardware to run this project:

Samsung GEAR VR

A Samsung GEAR VR compatible phone - (there are many phones that are GEAR VR compatible but there's also multiple versions of GEAR VR devices, the one we used was the Samsung GEAR VR SM-323, and the phone we used to test our application was the Samsung S7.
For a complete list of compatible devices see this link: https://www.unlockunit.com/blog/samsung-gear-vr-compatible-phones/)

A bluetooth capable Playstation 4 or Xbox One controller. (More controllers may be possible but it depends on the phone you have.)

Once you have this hardware you will need to simply install the linked APK in the demo link and install it on your phone.
Before running the application, connect the wireless game controller to your phone. Press and hold the bluetooth input of your controller, with a PS4 pad it's pressing and holding the share button plus the PS Home button until the LED bar starts blinking.

Next turn on the Bluetooth capabilities in your phone. On a Samsung S7 it's in the Settings. Then tap on the device named "Wireless Controller".

Finally, launch the application installed on your phone and you're good to go. 

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and then open this game within the Unity editor and hit play, but this game was built to be played in VRand as such the visuals controls are better suited for it. You will NOT be able to rotate the camera without being in VR.


Controls and Objective of this application:
Simply move the controllers Joystick to move the ball. On a VR headset, move your head to move the camera around. This game is very simple, just roll the ball to the finish line, avoid all obstacles and don't fall off the platforms throughout 3 different levels.


# Imported Assets:

Low Poly Styled rocks - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/low-poly-styled-rocks-43486 - 3D models for rocks

Planet Earth Free - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/planet-earth-free-23399 - a model of the planet Earth

Platform Builder Pro - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/platform-builder-pro-71395 - an in-Unity tool to create in-game platform models

Sci-fi platforms- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-platforms-83091 - models for some 3D platforms with a sci fi theme

Earth and Planets Skyboxes - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/earth-planets-skyboxes-53752 - space themed skyboxes, we oly used the Purple Nebula one

Star Creation Tools - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/star-creation-tools-80595 - 3D models for stars and the Sun.

# Duties:

Ray - Imported the GEAR VR SDK, testing on live devices, all the level 1 and level 3 platforms. Imported the Earth and Sun models as playable characters. Player controller script. Imported the space skybox.

Luciano - Level 3 platforms. Deadpool playable character.

# Issues:

Using the headset's touchpad as a controller for the player's movement. Instead we had to bring in a PS4 controller and use the joystick to achieve movement

Time constraints. For this project we only had two weeks to work on it as such that's why there's only 3 levels in the game.

# Tutorials' and other Resources Used:

Surprisingly, we didn't use any tutorials this time. We learned everything we needed to know on previous Unity projects. We just applied them here.
